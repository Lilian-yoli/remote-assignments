	      <p>Famed for centuries as Ilha Formosa (Beautiful Isle; 美麗島; Měilìdǎo), this is a land with more sides than the 11-headed Guanyin. Towering sea cliffs, marble-walled gorges and tropical forests are just the start of your journey, which could take you as far as Yushan, Taiwan's 3952m alpine roof.</p>

	        <h3>Island of Mountains</h3>
	        <p>The Baiyue (Mandarin:台灣百嶽) is a list of one hundred mountains in Taiwan. They were chosen by a group of prominent Taiwanese hikers from mountains known at the time to be over 3,000 meters in height. The selection criteria included uniqueness, danger, height, beauty and prominence. Preference was also given to peaks already named and those with triangulation points.[1][2] As such, "Top" does not refer strictly to the highest peaks by elevation, but rather peaks most worth hiking. </p>

	        <h3>Delicacy Cusine</h3>
	        <p>'Have you eaten?' The words are used as a greeting here, and the answer is almost always 'yes', as there's just too much nibbling to do. Taiwan offers the gamut of Chinese cuisines, the best Japanese outside Japan, and a full house of local specialities from Tainan milkfish and Taipei beef noodles to indigenous barbecued wild boar. Night markets serve endless feasts of snacks including oyster omelettes, shrimp rolls and shaved ice. </p>
